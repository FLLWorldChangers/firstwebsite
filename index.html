<h1> Welcome to my first website. </h1>
<p> Itâ€™s official. Computer coding is cool! Unlocking creativity, opening doors, fostering engagement and empowering youth; coding is way more fun than you might have thought. You can code, too!</p>
<h2>Five reasons coding is important:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Teaches logical thinking</li>
<li>Fosters creativity</li>
<li>Helps with math skills - visualize abstract concepts, apply math to real-world situations, and makes math fun and creative</li>
<li>Improves writing by praciticing how to plan and organize thoughts</li>
<li>Builds confidence to solve problems</li>
</ol>

<h3>I have been learning the following code: </h3>
<ul>
<li> HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language </li>
<li> CSS - Cascading Style Sheets </li>
<li> JavaScript </li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer: </h3>
<p> I tried to go too big, too soon. That wasn't working, so I scaled back to keep things simple for now. Check back for updates.</p>
